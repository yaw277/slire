## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-14
### Changed
- Docs: README — fix internal links/anchors

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-13
### Chore
- CI: fix GitHub Actions workflow for the 1.0.0 release (no functional code changes).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-13
### Breaking
- MongoDB helper rename: `applyConstraints` has been renamed to `applyFilter` on `MongoRepo`. Update any direct `repo.applyConstraints(...)` usages to `repo.applyFilter(...)`.
- Stricter filter typing and validation: `Filter<T>` and the runtime validator now only accept scalar values on leaf fields (including dot-paths like `'metadata.assigneeId'`). Passing nested objects/arrays (for example `{ metadata: { foo: 'bar' } }`) is now rejected by types and/or at runtime; this may surface previously-silent bugs.
- Stricter `options` typing on repo factories: `createMongoRepo` / `createFirestoreRepo` now expose a strongly-typed `options` parameter matching the repo config. Mis-typed or unknown config keys that previously compiled may now fail type-checking.

### Changed
- Docs: clarify filter semantics, helper naming, and configuration options.
